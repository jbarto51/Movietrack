Program to be able to ask for and send recommendations for movies using Discord and ChatGPT.
This program uses themoviedb API to search for recommendations based on different parameters, including movie title, actors, director, release date, genre, and streaming service. Users use a Discord bot to get the results and be able to send recommendations to others in the server. For the program to work, you need credentials for openai, discord, mongodb and themoviedb, as well as setting up a MongoDB database and discord bot and server.
